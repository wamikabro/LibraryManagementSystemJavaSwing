class present in the "Project" folder of "src" accordingly.
> To use Local Database, install XAMPP. To install zamp, follow the
provided link. 
> https://www.apachefriends.org/
> And to connect XAMPP with the database, you need to start Apache 
and MySQL in the XAMPP Control Panel which will eventually be installed
with XAMPP.
> To setup the Database for the provided LibraryManagementSystemPro
program, copy the SQL Script from provided "SQL Script" txt file,
and run it in the PhpMyAdmin of your Database, simply by going to

> If you're using Cloud Based Database, then your Database provider
